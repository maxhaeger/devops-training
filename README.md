### Git Usage
Regularly push your progress to the repository (daily or after each topic).
Alternatively, create a feature branch for each topic and submit a pull request (e.g., task/linux, task/docker), marking the reviewer.

### Communication
If you have questions, concerns, or difficulties, feel free to reach out via message or Slack-Huddle.
The reviewer will try to help and guide you in the right direction.
